Coding is one of the most amazing things you can do in the world. You can build games like flappy bird. You can build apps like Notion. And you can start companies like Facebook.

It's a skill you have to learn if you want to be part of creating the internet.

Introduction
============

I've been coding for 6 years and worked at large companies including Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.

If you're interested in being a successful programmer, we'll first have to learn how to build a programmer's mindset.

That sets the foundation to learn the coding choices that make sense and how to be even more efficient coding.

This is everything you should know when you're learning how to code.

Mindset
=======

What surprises a lot of people is that the only difference between regular developers and great developers is their mindset around problem solving.

All the information about coding is out there. The only difference is how they approach problem solving.

Programmers usually have two types of mindsets. They'll either get really frustrated or really curious if they see a bug.

If they're frustrated, they complain about the problem without trying to fix it. If they're curious, they'll think about where those bugs are coming from and what they can do to fix them.

Curiosity
---------

To explain it clearly, great programmers have growth mindsets. They're curious about how things work and how to make things better.

When you're coding do you understand the root cause of your issues?

-   The syntax for that language?
-   What's causing the bugs?
-   What's breaking unit tests?

It's going to take more time to learn all the details but that's what makes you a better programmer.

But you don't have time to learn everything. What most people forget is that code is meant for building things like apps and websites.

That means you're not supposed to know every niche detail about every language.

The intent of code
------------------

If you know one javascript framework then you know enough to make a webpage. You don't need to learn another javascript framework. *(*Looking at* you React, Vue, Svelte, Angular)*

Be comfortable not knowing everything. As long as you know what documentation to read and what examples to follow, you'll always be prepared for any learning challenge.

This is all part of problem solving your own issues. Being a programmer, means being a problem solver and solving your own issues. It can be frustrating and feel really hard.

But don't let up.

If you feel stuck, it's not because you're dumb. It's because you're being challenged. And being challenged is a good thing because that means you're learning a lot.

Coding Choices

You don't learn how to drive or how to swim by reading a book.

The best way to learn how to code is by coding. Not by reading books. Not by watching videos, but by being out there in front of your desk, with your IDE and actually coding.

There's a lot of technology out there but here's what you should focus on:

Start with learning one language really really well. Every language has for loops, while loops, recursion, if statements. That means learn the foundation for one language before being a programming polygot.

Just start with one to build your logical reasoning and learn all the other languages later.

If you feel unsure, I recommend either Python or Javascript.

1.  Python because it's easier to read and learn. If you feel like it's too easy just remember that most universities have python as part of their curriculum.
2.  Javascript to build websites. The dopamine to see their code come to life is a very strong motivator for most beginners.

You're not locked into this starter language for life. Just choose one and learn the other one later.

Object-oriented Programming
---------------------------

Every engineer needs to know object programming. You do that by learning an object oriented programming language.

Pick up either Java or C++.

For both options, they have huge communities. That means any bug you'll run into has probably been asked as a stack overflow question.

To explain nuances, C++ will teach you a little more about parallel computing.

Designing Apps
--------------

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*com05M0CL8Xev6v_P5ELZA.jpeg)

Every programmer must learn about databases. All of software engineering is just taking a database object and sending it somewhere else.

To do that you'll need to learn either SQL or NoSQL. SQL is common choice because it's widespread and has been around longer.

Bring all these technologies together to build an app. In other words, software engineering is creating a server with an API to interact with a database.

Third-Party API's
-----------------

The next step beyond this is to use someone else's API's instead of your own.

The most popular API a few years ago was Google Maps. It was trendy thing to see an entire map loaded with just a single API call.

But to keep up with changing times, using ChatGPT and other GenAI APIs will help beginner programmers stand out.

This means using these API's

-   [DocAI](https://cloud.google.com/document-ai)
-   [WhisperAI](https://openai.com/index/whisper/)
-   [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home)
-   [And of course ChatGPT](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction)

When you're comfortable with coding, we can start talking about how to be efficient.

Efficiency
----------

Efficiency is important because everyone is learning how to code but some learn faster than others. It's not because they're smarter. It's because they have better work flows.

Browsing the Internet

50% of your time is coding, the other 50% is googling something. To start, you have to be efficient using your browsing and learn how to use your browser shortcuts

The shortcuts I use are to open a tab, close a tab, switch tabs, and jump to the search bar.

Terminal Typing

The next thing every developer needs to know is how to use the terminal. That's because not everything is going to have an interface. Learn everything you need following [this handbook.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/command-line-for-beginners/)

In fact, you'll move a lot quicker using the terminal than if you're always reaching for your mouse to click on buttons.

The less you use your mouse, the faster you'll code.

Intelligent IDE's and Version control.

When you're coding, settle on 1 IDE and learn the shortcuts for it. It doesn't matter which one you use but I personally like VSCode because of the extensions.

At the same time, any company you work at will have some sort of version control system for their code. It's good to start now to learn the flows of pushing your code and fixing merge conflicts.

The most popular option is Git (mercurial at Google). Learn from their [official handbook here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).

Effective Debugging
-------------------

Programming is 5% coding 95% debugging.

One of the best ways to do that is by going through documentation. There's just more information there than anywhere else. It just takes time to go through it to figure out what you need to know.

Book Reading
============

The last thing I wish I did more when I was learning how to code was reading books.

Most of the time what made my code hard to debug was because it wasn't organized well.

If we spend so much time on debugging, then we should read books on it.

-   [Pragmatic Programmer.](https://amzn.to/3ASykIk)
-   [A Philosophy of Software Design](https://amzn.to/3Mo3slC)
-   [Clean code](https://amzn.to/4e0QiHe)
-   [Refactoring legacy code](https://amzn.to/4dXTxiu)

Engineering books are not made to be read cover to cover. They're just reference books to learn a coding tip or two. You don't have to understand the code examples but you do have to understand the ideas they present in the book.

This structure for learning how to code is important because it will help when you're looking for a job.

To work at any large tech company, you'll have to do Leetcode style questions to pass your coding interviews.

An important bit of advice studying is to only use one language for all your Leetcode problems. It doesn't matter if it's java or python, commit to one.

Studying Coding Problems
------------------------

[Cracking the Coding Interview](https://amzn.to/3YXftWP) --- I recommend people start with Cracking the Coding Interview. The book is easy but it gives you structure if you don't know where to start. There's also a lot of explanations to help you if you're a beginner.

[LeetCode 75](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/leetcode-75/) --- Then you'll move on to learn questions in the . The questions are a bit harder but they give you the fundamentals you'll need to pass coding interviews.

[Elements of Programming Interviews](https://amzn.to/3T5SrZW) --- To take a step further, pick up the book Elements of Programming Interviews. This book is more challenging to study but it teaches you how to solve coding problems at the FAANG level. But don't start here if you're still learning the basics.

[CSES](https://cses.fi/) --- Now the only thing that will prepare you even more than this is CSES. This website has problems that are much harder than what you would find on LeetCode. If you can solve questions down to the graph section, you'll be more than ready for any FAANG interview.

You'll be an amazing programmer and the world is waiting for what you're going to contribute.
